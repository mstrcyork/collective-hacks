# collective-hacks
Repo for various MSTRC Coding Collective hacks

## Examples on the p5.js site

* [Towards Snake!](https://editor.p5js.org/tomthecollins/sketches/DOBzEdnCr). A first attempt at a "sketch" in p5.js. From Coding collective on 9th October, 2020: "Coding session 1: Introduction to JavaScript and p5.js"
* "Getting closer to Snake!". Not much further than the sketch above, but rearrangement of code into a "Snake class", which will help going forward, and is our first encounter with something called object-oriented programming. Also from Coding collective on 9th October, 2020: "Coding session 1: Introduction to JavaScript and p5.js"

## Examples on Glitch
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) is wonderful because it's free and gets you set up immediately with a basic webpage, or an app with a Node.js server, or an app with a Node.js server and SQLite database.

The following examples from Coding Collective are on Glitch:

* [collective-p5-template](https://glitch.com/~collective-p5-template), which shows some basic functionality possible with creative coding language [p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/);
* [collective-p5-tone-template](https://glitch.com/~collective-p5-tone-template), which shows how to add in [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for powerful browser-based audio manipulation. (p5.js has some of its own audio capabilities, but Tom and many others in the web audio community would recommend Tone.js.

## Examples in the source code of this repository...
are several. Further explanations to be added soon!
